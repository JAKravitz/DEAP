# Distributed Equivalent Algal Populations (dEAP) model
Operational two layer coated sphere modeling for aquatic particle optics leveraging NASA AMES distributed computing for speed and scaling

1. EAP - general EAP model for creating synthetic spectral libraries of multiple phytoplankton  
2. EAP-MC - EAP model for vacuolate phytoplankton (M. aeruginosa)  
3. TwoLay - two layer code for creating synthetic spectral libraries for a collection of non-algal particle species  

Code leverages GNU-Parallel and is currently setup to be run on NASA High End Computing Center (HECC), but should be straightforward to config to a different distributed computing system.
